# Image Recognition with Deep Learning

This project explores two key areas in computer vision:
1. **Face Detection & Recognition** using MTCNN + VGGFace
2. **General Image Classification** using CNNs and Transfer Learning

## üîç Project Overview
| Approach | Task | Model | Highlights |
|---------|------|--------|------------|
| Facial Recognition | Face detection + recognition | MTCNN + VGGFace | Preprocessing-heavy, robust to real-world faces |
| Image Classification | Object classification | VGG16, ResNet (Transfer Learning) | Lightweight and generalizable |

## üìÅ Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with full implementations.
