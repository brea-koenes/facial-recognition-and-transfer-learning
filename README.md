# Image Recognition with Deep Learning

This project explores two key areas in computer vision:
1. **Face Detection & Recognition** using MTCNN + VGGFace
2. **General Image Classification** using CNNs and Transfer Learning

## üîç Project Overview
| Approach | Task | Model | Highlights |
|---------|------|--------|------------|
| Facial Recognition | Face detection + recognition | MTCNN + VGGFace | Preprocessing-heavy, robust to real-world faces |
| Image Classification | Object classification | VGG16, ResNet (Transfer Learning) | Lightweight and generalizable |

## üìÅ Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with full implementations.
- `src/`: Modular Python code for reuse and clarity.
- `examples/`: Demo output images for quick visual understanding.
- `comparison.ipynb`: Comparative analysis notebook (performance, trade-offs).

## üìä Results
Include some charts or tables from your comparison notebook here.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-recognition-project.git
cd image-recognition-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
